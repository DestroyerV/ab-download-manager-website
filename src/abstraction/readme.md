# Purpose


Here is my adapters to adapt my abstraction code to any specific framework

I created this directory to move all of my codes 
that require modification when I changing my underlying framework
goes here


for example I will create a MyLink
which based on my framework if I use next I will import `next/navigation`
or in pure react I will use `react-router`
